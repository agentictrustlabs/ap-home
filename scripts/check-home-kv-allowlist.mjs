// check:home-kv-allowlist (spec 323 W5) — the KV-creep gate.
//
// After spec 323, demo-sso-next's Cloudflare KV may hold ONLY (C) rebuildable caches/projections of
// data whose canonical home is the vault/DO/KB/chain, and (E) ephemeral ceremony state. NO durable
// capability, private graph, or delegation WIRE may live in KV — those moved to the per-principal
// InteractionsDO / owner vault so a second Home reaches them (docs/architecture/portable-home.md).
//
// This gate extracts every KV key prefix the app touches (AUTH_CODES.put/get/delete + `*Key`/KEY
// helper definitions) and fails on any prefix not in the classified ALLOWLIST below. Adding a new
// durable KV namespace forces a reviewer to either (a) classify it C/E with a rationale here, or
// (b) — if it's real capability/graph/wire state — put it in the vault/DO instead (the whole point).

  // Spec 397 W4 — the person-level app wires (the Home MCP's ask-as-me) a person authorized, so Connected assistants can
  // LIST and REVOKE them. The wire itself is signed by the person, held by the app's Worker and revocable ON CHAIN; this
  // is the index of which apps were granted. KNOWN GAP (HOME-PORT-2, OPEN): the honest home is the person's vault

  // HONEST CLASSIFICATION: these are NOT caches and there is no vault original to rebuild from —

  // the entry above (`delegated-idx`) sets the precedent that an unverified rebuild path gets said
  // out loud instead of asserted.
  //
  // WHY IT CANNOT SIMPLY MOVE TO THE OWNER'S VAULT (yet): `/oidc/authorize-grant` must resolve a
  // `client_id` for an ANONYMOUS visitor — someone arriving at the Home before any session for that
  // client exists. A vault read needs the owner's delegation, which is precisely what is absent at
  // that moment. So the gate needs a Home-readable copy.
  //
  // THE PORTABLE SHAPE, tracked as follow-up: authoritative record in the registering member's vault,
  // KV as its projection — the `related:`/`skills:` pattern — so a wipe rebuilds from vaults and a
  // second Home reconstructs the registry. Until that exists, a wipe loses member registrations.
  'oidc-app': { class: 'cache', why: 'member-registered OIDC client. KNOWN GAP: NOT rebuildable — no vault original exists yet; the portable shape (vault-authoritative + KV projection) is tracked follow-up. Home-readable because the OIDC gate resolves client_id for an anonymous caller.' },
