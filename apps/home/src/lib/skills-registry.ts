// THE SKILLS REGISTRY, READ FROM THE HOME — agent-rules/one-capability-model-generates-both.
//
// A domain author writes a SKILL.md execution contract in the skills app and links it to an archetype.
// The registry compiles that into an `AgentHarnessDefinitionV1`. This is how the Home READS those, so a
// contract edited over there changes what an agent does over here — without a deploy, and without the
// capability being written a second time in this repo.
//
// READ-ONLY, and deliberately: the Home never authors a definition (spec 354 — the compiler owns that,
// this repo consumes). What the Home does with one is the K3 ceremony: show the diff, and on approval
// write the assignment to the agent's own vault. A definition is behaviour; it grants nothing.
//
// FAIL-SOFT. An unreachable registry leaves the app-config catalog standing (spec 354 §3 defaults), which
// is why `catalogForKind` remains the floor rather than the fallback-of-last-resort: both are real
// sources and the registry is the one a domain author can change.
