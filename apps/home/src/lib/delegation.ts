/** The A2A skills an Operational Intent grant may carry. Named here so the minting side and the
 *  org's gate derive the SAME selectors from the SAME strings — a selector computed from a drifting
 *  string list is a grant that silently authorizes nothing.
 *
 *  THE OTHER COPY IS `ENDEAVOR_REQUEST_SKILL_ID` in demo-a2a (`src/endeavor-intake.ts`), which is the
 *  registered handler these selectors have to reach. Two copies because neither app depends on the
 *  other (the CONSULT_SKILL precedent); demo-a2a's test pins the derived selector
 *  (`endeavor.request` → `0x9db527f0`), so a change there fails loudly. A change HERE does not —
 *  edit both, or every minted grant stops matching a gate that looks correct.
 *
 *  Only `endeavor.request` is a registered skill today. `adoptPlan` is steward-gated at the reducer
 *  and `state` has no handler yet, so a message naming either is rejected as `unknown skill` — inert,
 *  not dangerous, and the reason the grant is minted with room for them.
 *
 *  THE RELAY PAIR lets a holder ask this org to dispatch to a SPECIALIST on another organization,
 *  and read the result back. It does NOT widen where the org can reach: the relay forwards only to
 *  hosts and archetypes the org already holds its own grant for, so a holder gains the org's reach
 *  and never more. Two methods because the holder is not a party to the task the host creates.
 *
 *  This list is GLOBAL — every app that mints an operational grant mints these too. Acceptable
 *  because a selector naming a skill the holder cannot usefully invoke is inert (see above), and
 *  because per-app selector sets would put the authorization surface in a config file where a typo
 *  is silent. Revisit if an app ever needs a NARROWER grant than this. */
