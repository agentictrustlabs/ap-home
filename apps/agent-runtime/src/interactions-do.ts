   * scoped read. The caveat's PRESENCE is what makes this a data grant, so its absence fails first.
   *
   * WRITES AND DELETES GO THROUGH THE SAME DOOR, with the op the caller is actually performing —
   * `content.put` carrying `data: null` is a DELETE, and admitting it as a write would let a grant
   * that says `ops: ['write']` erase records. The op is decided at the call site from the payload,
   * not inferred here.
   *
   * NEVER THE AGGREGATE. `content.catalog` is one record listing every artifact in the organization,
   * so a scoped writer who could rewrite it could drop another community's records from the index
   * while holding a grant that names only their own. The call site refuses it before asking; there is
   * no scope string that should buy it, which is why the refusal is structural and not a policy line.

   * steward's session SA is by definition NOT the principal. So those ops stayed bridge-only — a
   * shared secret standing in for authority, which is exactly what this spec exists to remove.
   *
   * The proof is the org's stewardship delegation, verified the same way `messaging.*` and
   * `consult.routingEnable` verify it: delegator is this org, delegate is the caller, stewardship
   * SHAPE not merely member access (SEC-C1), ERC-1271-live and unrevoked. That is strictly stronger
   * than the secret it replaces — the secret proves the CALLER is our Home, and nothing about whether
   * the person behind it may act for this organization.
   *
   * Caller-selected, never a fallback (ADR-0013): a request carrying `session` takes the delegation
   * path and fails closed there; one carrying the SEC-010 envelope takes the bridge. Neither is tried
   * after the other fails.
   *
   * IDENTITY IS EITHER TOKEN; AUTHORITY IS ALWAYS THE DELEGATION. `verifyHomeSession` pins
   * `aud = DEMO_SSO_AUD`, so a REGISTERED relying app — which by construction holds `aud = client_id`
   * — was refused here even when the person behind it stewards the org. That is the same asymmetry
   * §4.2 already closed for `ownerOrBridge`, left open on the steward path: an org's Content
   * Artifacts were reachable from the Home and from nowhere else, so every Connect client had to
   * either give up or reach for the shared secret.
   *
   * WHY ACCEPTING THE SECOND TOKEN GRANTS NOTHING NEW. Both verifiers resolve to a PERSON's SA and
   * nothing more; the decision that follows is `isSteward(principal, sa, stewardship)` — delegator is
   * this org, delegate is that person, stewardship SHAPE not mere membership, ERC-1271-live and
   * unrevoked on-chain. An app cannot manufacture that, and presenting someone else's wire does not
   * help, because the wire must name the person its own token proves. So the token answers *who is
   * asking* and the delegation answers *may they act for this org* — unchanged.
   *
   * WHY THIS DIFFERS FROM `ownerOrBridge`, which deliberately refuses a relying app that presents
   * stewardship: there, the principal is a PERSON, so accepting stewardship would let an app holding
   * a person's token pivot to a DIFFERENT principal — an escalation. Here the principal is ALREADY
   * the org, and stewardship is the only authority that ever reaches it. There is nothing to pivot to.
   *
   * RESIDUAL RISK, stated rather than implied: any app the person authorized can act for every org
   * that person stewards, because they all share the person's one identity. Narrowing that needs the
   * per-app scoped grants of §4.1/§4.3, not an audience check — an audience check only decided which
   * ONE app could do it, and made a real client indistinguishable from an attacker.

            THE INDEX IS MAINTAINED HERE, NOT REPLACED BY THE CALLER.

            `content.catalog` lists every artifact in the organization, and demo-sso-next rewrites the
            WHOLE list on every save (`library.ts` — `scope.write(list)` runs before the artifact is
            written). For a steward that is harmless: they may write all of it anyway. For a SCOPED
            writer it is the entire problem — replacing the index wholesale would let a grant naming
            one community drop another community's records out of it, which is a deletion wearing a
            save, and it would also let a stale list roll back somebody else's concurrent write.

            So a scoped caller's catalog write is MERGED. Entries their grant actually covers are
            taken from the submission; every other entry is preserved from what is stored. They cannot
            remove what they could not have written. A steward still replaces the list outright —
            merging for them would only stop their deletes working.

     * OWNER-ONLY OPS — spec 341 §4.3c, the audit of this block.
     *
     * THE CLASS. Every op here is reachable with a relying id_token, because this block has accepted
     * one since before per-app grants existed. Its self-checks read `sessionSa === principal`, and that
     * is TRUE for any app holding the person's token — the subject IS the person. So "self access only"
     * meant "the person, or anything they ever connected", which is not what it says and not what a
     * person reading it would expect.
     *
     * THE LINE. A relying app AUTHENTICATES as the person; it is not the person. Ops that CONFIGURE the
     * person's agent or write their private records belong to the owner. Ops a relying app legitimately
     * drives — `channels.*`, `directory.*` — are steward/member-gated by a delegation and are the
     * documented use; they are deliberately untouched.
     *
     * WHY THESE, specifically:
     *  · `readgrant.*` — GRANT MANAGEMENT. Left open, any connected app could revoke another app's read
     *    grant (a denial of service against its peers) or install one under a clientId of its choosing.
     *    An app administering the very mechanism that bounds apps is the sharpest edge found here.
     *  · `relationships.*` — person↔org links are PRIVATE vault credentials, never app-readable
     *    (ADR-0025). This is the one with the clearest existing doctrine and no gate enforcing it.
     *  · `inbox.assistant*` — the auto-reply config and the SKILL.md playbook. An app could rewrite what
     *    the person's agent says on their behalf, which is authorship, not access.
     *  · `member.profile.put`, `membership.put` — identity and membership writes.
     *  · `grants.list` — enumerating a person's authority surface.
     *
     * Verified against both live consumers before landing: `uupg` drives `channels.*`, `status` and the
     * `messaging.*` rail; the `~/skills` registry drives none of these. Neither is affected.
